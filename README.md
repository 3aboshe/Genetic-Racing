GA F1 Racing — Interactive Teaching Simulation

How to run

- Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari).
- Use the controls to start/pause/reset and adjust speed, population, mutation rate, etc.

What it teaches

- Basic 2D car physics and a proportionate F1 car model.
- Genetic Algorithm flow: population, fitness, selection, crossover, mutation.
- Step-by-step math for neural decision-making and genetic operations, visible in the panel.

Files

- `index.html` — UI and canvas.
- `style.css` — basic styling.
- `main.js` — simulation, GA and visualization.

Notes

This is a lightweight, single-file browser simulation intended for classroom demonstrations and experimentation. If you'd like, I can split the code into modules, add unit tests, or package it as a small static site with a bundler.
